Replicating Strategy
--------------------------


This exercise was done as part of my Master in [Quantitative Finance ](http://eesp.fgv.br/ensino/mestrado-profissional/economia/area-financas-quantitativas), at the [FGV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundação_Getúlio_Vargas) University. You can check my report <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ucaiado/Replicating_Strategy/blob/master/UiraCaiadoEx01.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a> (the text is in portuguese). I will implement a dynamic strategy that uses self-financing hedging to replicate the payoff of a derivative that is described as a [stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process). I will use mostly Python to code the project.
